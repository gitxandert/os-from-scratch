# Building an OS from Scratch

Follow <a href="https://gitxandert.github.io/resume-portfolio/blogs/">my blog</a> for my thoughts on systems-level considerations.

I built the kernel by following <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDev.org</a>'s <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones">Bare Bones</a> tutorial.

The shell (to be integrated) is a modification of the sketch provided in Chapter 1 of Advanced Programming in Unix Environments, Third Edition; it will work in even a bare bones POSIX kernel, though this specific one has yet to be integrated (and improved). Modifications to come.
