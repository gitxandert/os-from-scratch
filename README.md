#Building an OS from Scratch

Why am I building an OS from scratch? Read <a href="https://gitxandert.github.io/resume-portfolio/blogs/">my blog</a> to find out.

I built the kernel by following <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDev.org</a>'s <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones">Bare Bones</a> tutorial. I built the iso and tried it out in QEMU; it works! But I want to get a USB for it before I try it out on hardware.
